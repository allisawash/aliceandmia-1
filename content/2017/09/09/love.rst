summary: |
  “A few months into my gender transition
  I’m living full-time as a woman.
  I don’t have many guy friends, but my guitarist is one.
  Parting, I lean in for the cheek-kiss
  but he plants a good one right on my lips.
  His wife raises an amused eyebrow,
  *Ha, well, I guess you two get to do that now.*”
