Twined Fragments
****************

`Twined Fragments`_
is an ongoing collaboration between authors
`Miriam Suzanne`_ & `Allison Washington`_.
Each fragment is sparked by the previous,
as trans women of different generations
pass their memories back and forth,
reflecting on lives and transitions separated by a quarter-century.

.. epigraph::

  Working through these fragments of reflection
  lets us touch on moments and emotions
  that are sometimes too painful to interrogate deeply.
  In conversation, we do together what we could not alone.
  The result leaves us with more questions than answers,
  and we love that.

We want those questions,
and hope you will extend this conversation in the comments,
on social media,
or by `contacting us`_ directly.
